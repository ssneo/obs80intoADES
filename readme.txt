The purpose of this code is to provide a user interface that will read Astrometrica's Obs80 information, extract more information about the observations from astrometrica.log file
and then calculate a pos_unc. After all of the data is extracted, give the user a one-click option to submit the observation including the uncertainty information to the minor planet center via ADES.
